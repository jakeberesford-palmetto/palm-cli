Containerization
================

**Beta Feature**
Note that this feature is intended to provide a basic baseline for containerization.
For more complicated projects, we recommend spending some time to implement your own
containerization solution. The code generated by Palm may serve as a good starting point.

Containerization (with Docker) is a pre-requisite for using Palm with your project.
We understand that you may not be a Docker pro, but we can help you get started with
dockerizing your project so that you can use Palm!


How to containerize your project
================================

Palm ships with basic containerization for Python projects.

**Before you start**

- Make sure your project is initialized with ``palm init``, the image_name 
  configuration will be used by the containerization tool.
- You should ensure you have a .env file in your project root directory. This file
  should include the environment variables you need to run your project. It should
  also be added to your .gitignore file.
- You need to be using requirements.txt or poetry.lock to manage your dependencies.
  If you are using a different package management system, please open an issue on 
  Github and we will consider adding support for it.

Use ``palm containerize`` to set up your project with Docker.

See ``palm containerize --help`` for more information.

How containerization works
===========================

Palm containerization generates the following files in your project root directory:

- Dockerfile: The Dockerfile used to build your project
- docker-compose.yml: Docker compose is used to load the .env file and volume 
  mount your project code so that you can make changes without having to rebuild 
  or restart the container.
- scripts/entrypoint.sh: This script is used to run your project. It is executed 
  by the Dockerfile as it's entrypoint. This is where your dependencies are 
  installed. Note: we do not recommend executing your project code directly in 
  the entrypoint as this limits the flexibility of your container, instead use 
  palm commands to run your project, this allows you to determine what each instance
  of the container is doing (run, test, etc.).
